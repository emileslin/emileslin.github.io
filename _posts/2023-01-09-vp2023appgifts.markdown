Applications for [Viable Paradise](https://viableparadise.com/), a one-week speculative fiction writing workshop that takes place on Martha's Vineyard in October, are open for 2023. I went to it last year, learned so much and met my amazing cohort, and highly recommend it.

A bunch of alums are also sponsoring application fees. And because my cohort loves spreadsheets, we made one listing them [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dcWj5JJB8VhAdVTkZxOt7yWwGtfgpiMeRaA1vlOPgPY/edit?usp=sharing). Please share it with anyone you know who's thinking of applying and could use the support.
